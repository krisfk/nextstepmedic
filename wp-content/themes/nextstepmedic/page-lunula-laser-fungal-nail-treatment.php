            <div class="mt-3">Nail fungus is a common condition that begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of
                your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, nail fungus may cause your nail to
                discolour, thicken and crumble at the edge. It can affect several nails.

                    <div class="col-6">Fungal nail infections are caused by various fungal organisms (fungi). The most
                        common cause is a type of fungus called dermatophyte. Yeast and molds also can cause nail
                        infections. <br><br>

                        It can develop in people at any age, but it's more common in older adults. As the nail ages, it
                        can become brittle and dry. The resulting cracks in the nails allow fungi to enter. Other
                        factors — such as reduced blood circulation to the feet and a weakened immune system — also may
                        play a role.<br><br>

                        Toenail fungal infection can also start from athlete's foot (foot fungus), and it can spread
                        from one nail to another. But it is uncommon to get an infection from someone else.

    <div class="service-subtitle mt-5">Treatments for Fungal Nails</div>


    <div class="mt-4">A typical Fungal Nail Consultation would involve the Podiatrist assessing and diagnosing the
        infected nails. In
        some cases, clippings or scrapings are taken and sent off site to be tested. The Podiatrist would then prep the
        nails, by cutting them back and grinding them down to remove some of the thickness. <br> <br>

        We would then run through the best treatment options for you, whether that be topical, oral or laser therapy,
        you’ll also be coached on how best to self-manage your issue so that it does not reoccur.<br><br>

        Fungal nail infections can be difficult to treat. Treatment depends on the severity of your condition and the
        type of fungus causing it.

                Topical treatment is usually the first line therapy for fungal nails. The condition of the nail can
                reflect
                the effectiveness of the treatment, so it is recommended you visit a Podiatrist before starting
                treatment.
                It is advised for all topical treatments, to gain the best results, that the nail is thinned as much as
                possible and, nail that may have lifted or become brittle, is cut away and exposes the nail bed. Without
                this, it may delay or lower the effectiveness of treatment. This allows the solution to penetrate the
                nail
                bed more effectively.

            </div>
            <div class="mt-3">
                Oral anti-fungal medication is still considered the gold standard in nail fungus treatment and it is
                reported to have a 70% success rate. A course on oral anti-fungal medication can last up to 12 weeks.
                The reason why its success is greater is because the medication is circulated in your blood stream and
                this treats the nail fungus 24 hrs around the clock. <br> <br>

                The main draw back with oral anti-fungal medication is that it is very strong medication and can often
                have nasty side effects, including liver damage. For this reason oral anti-fungal drugs are usually only
                prescribed following confirmation of diagnosis through pathology and treatment should be carefully
                monitored. Oral anti-fungal medication is best used for severe or chronic nail fungus infections or
                those which haven’t responded to conservative treatment.

                In cases where a nail infection has progressed to the “severe” stage and is extremely painful, your
                doctor may recommend removing your nail. A new nail will usually grow in its place, but it will come in
                slowly and may take as long as a year to grow back completely.  Sometimes surgery is used in combination
                with a topical solution that treats the nail bed to further inhibit the fungus.

                    <div class="col-6">This FDA-approved toenail fungus treatment is revolutionary. With low-level laser
                        energy, the Lunula Laser uses photochemistry to target the toenail fungus and stimulate blood
                        flow. Photochemistry is the science of light and colour.
                        <br><br>
                        With red and violet laser lights, the photochemical reaction caused by the laser kills the
                        fungus and stimulates new, clear toenail growth. While the laser aggressively treats the fungus,
                        it does not affect the rest of the toe or foot.
