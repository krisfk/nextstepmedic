                As children and toddlers grow and develop, they can suffer from a range of foot problems. We believe by

                becoming more problematic. Prevention is always better than cure!

            <div class="mt-3">

                Diabetes can reduce the blood supply and damage the nerves in your feet, leading to a number of serious
                foot problems which is why it is recommended to have a diabetes foot assessment performed by a
                podiatrist and ongoing podiatry care if necessary.

                <div class="hide-content">


                    Poor glucose control generally causes two main complications in the feet:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nerve damage that results in peripheral neuropathy</li>
                        <li>Poor blood supply & circulation</li>
                    </ul>
                    If nerve damage occurs, you may experience some of the following symptoms in your feet:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numbness or altered sensation</li>
                        <li>Pins & needles in the feet</li>
                        <li>Burning pain in the legs and feet, usually more noticeable at night</li>
                        <li>Coldness in the legs and feet. </li>
                    </ul>
                    Long Term Lower Limb Complications of Diabetes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loss of protective sensation</li>
                        <li>Decreased blood supply to the feet</li>
                        <li>Increased risk of infection</li>
                        <li>Diabetic foot ulcers, amputations and gangrene.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A diabetes foot assessment performed by a podiatrist every 3 to 12 months is advisable, depending on
                    your risk category, the podiatrist will use the following validated assessment tools to establish a
                    foot risk status:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Neurological Assessment </li>
                        <li>Vascular Assessment</li>
                        <li>Footwear assessment </li>
                        <li>Dermatological Assessment</li>
                        <li>Screen for skin cancers</li>
                        <li>General foot and Nail care </li>
                        <li>Diabetic foot health education and information </li>
                    </ul>

                    Once a foot risk status is determined, the podiatrist may make recommendations based on the results.
                    This may include recommendations for footwear modifications and orthotics to reduce high plantar
                    pressure sites that are at risk of ulceration. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Recommendations are made to help you achieve your goal and follow up appointments are scheduled
                    based on your specific needs and desired outcomes.
