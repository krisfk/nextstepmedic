                </div>

                The Next Step Medical Clinic is your one-stop orthopaedics, physiotherapy and podiatry centre for
                musculoskeletal pain, sports injury, foot pain and other related conditions. It is located at Unit 1101,
                70 Queen's Road Central, Central, the heart of the city and Hong Kong’s primary central business
                district.  <br> <br>

                Our team of medical specialists includes orthopaedics, physiotherapists and podiatrists who are all
                highly trained and have many years of experience in their chosen fields. We work together to provide the
                best possible treatment for your individual problems. We treat the causes of the pains and injuries, not
                only the symptoms. We will work with you to set goals and objectives that will help your recovery from
                surgery, your weekend sporting injuries and your everyday pain.
                <br> <br>

                Our team consists of local practitioners conversant in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and various
                dialects, and we strongly believe in delivering greater value and higher quality of care to our patients
                through effective communication and ethical clinical practice.
                <br> <br>

                Our vision is to explain treatments thoroughly, promote a preventative, long term approach to health
                care in a friendly and encouraging atmosphere, and empower patients to have the best quality of
                life they deserve. Be proactive and not inactive.
