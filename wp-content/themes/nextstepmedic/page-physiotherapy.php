                <div class="accordion-content">

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="col-6"> Mobilisations of joints and soft tissues are very useful techniques in
                            helping restore normal
                            movement. Mobilisations increase movement at stiff joints and thus allow you to access
                            better
                            movement patterns, postures and simply feel looser. <br> <br>

                            Mobilisations are graded by fully trained therapist accordingly and therefore can be applied
                            at
                            virtually any stage of the healing process to ensure good quality healing takes place. A
                            low-grade
                            mobilisation helps to reduce pain and stimulate healing, higher grades help to break down
                            unwanted
                            scar tissue, promote nutrition and increase range of motion. Mobilisations can be applied
                            with
                            movement. Such treatment is very effective as it encompasses activity within your muscles
                            with a
                            hands on technique to help return your movement back to ‘normal’.</div>

                    <div class="mt-3">Muscles generally work together in pairs to help promote good quality pain free
                        movement at a
                        joint. If you overuse certain muscles due to repetitive strain, sports, prolonged postures or
                        weakness in other parts of your body, you can develop tightness and dominance within one of the
                        pair. If the situation continues, stress and altered loading to the soft tissues may cause you
                        to
                        develop pain, tendinopathies, ligament sprains, muscle spasms, and the list is endless.
                        <br><br>
                        A qualified physiotherapist will help assess you for any muscle imbalances to include tightness
                        and
                        weakness of the soft tissues. Effective methods of treating such problems will be outlined in
                        forms
                        of things you can do to help yourself and techniques we can perform within our treatment to
                        help.

                        Stretching is a technique used to increase the length of muscles and tendons in order to improve
                        the
                        effectiveness of the muscle fibres, improve joint range of motion and relieve pain. Your
                        Physiotherapist will advise appropriate stretches to correct muscle length and elasticity.
                        Muscle
                        energy techniques or Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretches are used to lengthen
                        muscles through a hold and relax muscle contraction technique, this generally requires the
                        assistance of your therapist and is widely used by athletes to improve range of movement in a
                        joint
                        both before and after sport to improve performance and reduce risk of injury.

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="col-6"> A manipulation is a technique that can be applied to patients whose
                            condition is not easily irritated, if there is local muscle guarding then this must be
                            addressed first. Manipulations are quicker techniques performed at the end of the joints
                            range of motion, this helps to break down scar tissue and release pressure within the joint
                            which sometimes causes this technique to make a ‘crack’ known as a cavitation. Most commonly
                            spinal joints are those that we may choose to treat with manipulation, although these
                            treatment techniques can be used with other joints.
                            <br> <br>
                            Manipulations can demonstrate immediate improvements in the range and quality of movement
                            for the right category of patient, your Physiotherapist will assess your suitability for
                            these techniques and ensure you are fully aware of what to expect.

                        <div class="col-6"> Ultrasound is a small electrical device used to send high frequency sound
                            waves into your problem tissues. The sound waves penetrate the tissue and stimulate the
                            cells involved in healing to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair. Ultrasound can
                            be applied at any stage of healing, your therapist will alter the dose according to your
                            injury and phase of healing.
                            <br> <br>
                            Ultrasound treatment helps you to recover after acute injury, and may speed up recovery
                            times. Ultrasound at a high dose is also helpful in the management of calcific
                            tendinopathies to help break down and aid reabsorption of the calcium ions within the
                            tendon.
