                <div class="accordion-content">

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="col-6"> Mobilisations of joints and soft tissues are very useful techniques in
                            helping restore normal
                            movement. Mobilisations increase movement at stiff joints and thus allow you to access
                            better
                            movement patterns, postures and simply feel looser. <br> <br>

                            Mobilisations are graded by fully trained therapist accordingly and therefore can be applied
                            at
                            virtually any stage of the healing process to ensure good quality healing takes place. A
                            low-grade
                            mobilisation helps to reduce pain and stimulate healing, higher grades help to break down
                            unwanted
                            scar tissue, promote nutrition and increase range of motion. Mobilisations can be applied
                            with
                            movement. Such treatment is very effective as it encompasses activity within your muscles
                            with a
                            hands on technique to help return your movement back to ‘normal’.</div>

                    Jeff has experience in working with highly active individuals in military clinics. He also spent
                    time delivering community Physiotherapy services, where he gained knowledge and skills in working
                    with a variety of conditions including chronic pain, neurological, geriatric, as well as orthopedic
                    conditions. Jeff has strong passion in delivery patient-specific and evidence-based care. He is also
                    a firm believer of the proactive healthcare approach of which actions should be taken to prevent
                    health problems before they occur. He always tries his best to make his patients feel better,
