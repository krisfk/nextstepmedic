                    anatomical structure(s) are the source of your pain, and what underlying factors might be
                    contributing to the problem, such as weakness or biomechanical issues.

                    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12"> Mobilisations of joints and soft tissues are very
                        useful techniques in
                        helping restore normal
                        movement. Mobilisations increase movement at stiff joints and thus allow you to access
                        better
                        movement patterns, postures and simply feel looser. <br> <br>

                        Mobilisations are graded by fully trained therapist accordingly and therefore can be applied
                        at
                        virtually any stage of the healing process to ensure good quality healing takes place. A
                        low-grade
                        mobilisation helps to reduce pain and stimulate healing, higher grades help to break down
                        unwanted
                        scar tissue, promote nutrition and increase range of motion. Mobilisations can be applied
                        with
                        movement. Such treatment is very effective as it encompasses activity within your muscles
                        with a
                        hands on technique to help return your movement back to ‘normal’.</div>

                <div class="mt-3">Muscles generally work together in pairs to help promote good quality pain free
                    movement at a
                    joint. If you overuse certain muscles due to repetitive strain, sports, prolonged postures or
                    weakness in other parts of your body, you can develop tightness and dominance within one of the
                    pair. If the situation continues, stress and altered loading to the soft tissues may cause you
                    to
                    develop pain, tendinopathies, ligament sprains, muscle spasms, and the list is endless.
                    <br><br>
                    A qualified physiotherapist will help assess you for any muscle imbalances to include tightness
                    and
                    weakness of the soft tissues. Effective methods of treating such problems will be outlined in
                    forms
                    of things you can do to help yourself and techniques we can perform within our treatment to
                    help.
                    <br><br>
                    Stretching is a technique used to increase the length of muscles and tendons in order to improve
                    the
                    effectiveness of the muscle fibres, improve joint range of motion and relieve pain. Your
                    Physiotherapist will advise appropriate stretches to correct muscle length and elasticity.
                    Muscle
                    energy techniques or Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretches are used to lengthen
                    muscles through a hold and relax muscle contraction technique, this generally requires the
                    assistance of your therapist and is widely used by athletes to improve range of movement in a
                    joint
                    both before and after sport to improve performance and reduce risk of injury.

                    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12"> A manipulation is a technique that can be applied
                        to patients whose
                        condition is not easily irritated, if there is local muscle guarding then this must be
                        addressed first. Manipulations are quicker techniques performed at the end of the joints
                        range of motion, this helps to break down scar tissue and release pressure within the joint
                        which sometimes causes this technique to make a ‘crack’ known as a cavitation. Most commonly
                        spinal joints are those that we may choose to treat with manipulation, although these
                        treatment techniques can be used with other joints.
                        <br> <br>
                        Manipulations can demonstrate immediate improvements in the range and quality of movement
                        for the right category of patient, your Physiotherapist will assess your suitability for
                        these techniques and ensure you are fully aware of what to expect.

                        send high frequency sound
                        waves into your problem tissues. The sound waves penetrate the tissue and stimulate the
                        cells involved in healing to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair. Ultrasound can
                        be applied at any stage of healing, your therapist will alter the dose according to your
                        injury and phase of healing.
                        <br> <br>
                        Ultrasound treatment helps you to recover after acute injury, and may speed up recovery
                        times. Ultrasound at a high dose is also helpful in the management of calcific
                        tendinopathies to help break down and aid reabsorption of the calcium ions within the
                        tendon.

                        Massage is a soft tissue technique with direct influence on the muscles, tendons, ligaments
                        and other connective tissue. Massage has a number of physiological benefits including
                        increasing; circulation and oxygen flow, reducing inflammation and releasing endorphins.
                        Massage aims to alleviate aches and pains by relaxing muscles, improving joint range and
                        flexibility and ultimately speeding up recovery time.

                        TENS is a method of electrical stimulation which primarily aims to provide a degree of
                        symptomatic pain relief by exciting sensory nerves and thereby stimulating either the pain

                        Myofascial release is a specialised physical and manual therapy used in the treatment of
                        this
                        form of superficial connective soft tissue. The treatment method involves the application of
                        soft, yet firm, continuous pressure into the area of tension. The treatment aims to reduce
                        discomfort and restore normal tissue movement by causing an increased blood flow and the
                        fascia
                        to elongate. <br> <br>

                        Myofascial release is a fantastic tool to help manage conditions caused by restrictions
                        within
                        tight structures within the kinetic chain, myofascial release is helpful in the management
                        of
                        many musculoskeletal conditions, to name a few, we may use this type of technique to help
                        our
                        patients that suffer with plantar fasciitis, greater trochanteric pain syndromes, snapping
