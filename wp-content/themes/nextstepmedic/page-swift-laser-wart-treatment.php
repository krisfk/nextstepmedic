                weight-bearing areas of your feet. This pressure may also cause plantar warts to grow inward beneath a

                        Plantar warts are caused by an infection with HPV in the outer layer of skin on the soles of
                        your feet. They develop when the virus enters your body through tiny cuts, breaks or other weak
                        spots on the bottoms of your feet. HPV is very common, and more than 100 kinds of the virus
                        exist. But only a few of them cause warts on the feet. Other types of HPV are more likely to
                        cause warts on other areas of your skin or on mucous membranes.

                        The HPV strains that cause plantar warts are not highly contagious. The virus is not easily
                        transmitted by direct contact from one person to another. But it thrives in warm, moist
                        environments. Consequently, you may contract the virus by walking barefoot around swimming pools
                        or locker rooms. If the virus spreads from the first site of infection, more warts may appear.

    <div class="service-subtitle mt-5">What is SWIFT?</div>

    <div class="mt-5">SWIFT is a cutting-edge, FDA cleared technology that has proven to be highly effective in the
        removal of
        plantar warts. It delivers low dose microwave energy through a specialized probe that targets and treats the
        underlying HPV virus by stimulating a natural immune response in the body. SWIFT technology addresses the root
        cause and not the symptoms of plantar warts, thus preventing its recurrence.

                        Heat shock proteins within HPV infected cells are released, alerting the body to the presence of
                        the virus.

                    </ul>
                    Each treatment lasts only 5-10 minutes, consisting of 3-5 very short application of the SWIFT device
                    (usually 2 seconds in duration). SWIFT delivers a precise, highly controlled dose of microwave
                    energy to a pre-determined depth into the skin.

                    <ul class="grey-bold">
                        <li>Cleaner</li>
                    </ul>
                    Microwave therapy does not produce smoke, plume, or smell that laser or electrocautery devices
                    produce. The SWIFT device has been designed to ensure microwaves travel in straight lines with no
                    lateral spread, commonly seen in Cryotherapy. This results in a treatment that can be used to
                    accurately target
                    tissue and leave healthy tissue undamaged.
                    <br><br>
                    The SWIFT device also features a disposable tip – which removes the need for sterilization between
                    patients and eliminates the risk of cross-contamination.
                    <br><br>

                    The precision treatment of SWIFT does not break the skin – meaning no blisters, no padding, no
                    scarring – overall resulting to a cleaner, safer alternative.

                        condition is not easily irritated, if there is local muscle guarding then this must be
                        addressed first. Manipulations are quicker techniques performed at the end of the joints
                        range of motion, this helps to break down scar tissue and release pressure within the joint
                        which sometimes causes this technique to make a ‘crack’ known as a cavitation. Most commonly
                        spinal joints are those that we may choose to treat with manipulation, although these
                        treatment techniques can be used with other joints.
