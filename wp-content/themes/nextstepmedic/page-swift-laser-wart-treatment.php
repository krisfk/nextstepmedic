                weight-bearing areas of your feet. This pressure may also cause plantar warts to grow inward beneath a
                hard, thick layer of skin (callus).

                    <div class="col-6"> Mobilisations of joints and soft tissues are very useful techniques in
                        helping restore normal
                        movement. Mobilisations increase movement at stiff joints and thus allow you to access
                        better
                        movement patterns, postures and simply feel looser. <br> <br>

                        Mobilisations are graded by fully trained therapist accordingly and therefore can be applied
                        at
                        virtually any stage of the healing process to ensure good quality healing takes place. A
                        low-grade
                        mobilisation helps to reduce pain and stimulate healing, higher grades help to break down
                        unwanted
                        scar tissue, promote nutrition and increase range of motion. Mobilisations can be applied
                        with
                        movement. Such treatment is very effective as it encompasses activity within your muscles
                        with a
                        hands on technique to help return your movement back to ‘normal’.</div>

                    movement at a
                    joint. If you overuse certain muscles due to repetitive strain, sports, prolonged postures or
                    weakness in other parts of your body, you can develop tightness and dominance within one of the
                    pair. If the situation continues, stress and altered loading to the soft tissues may cause you
                    to
                    develop pain, tendinopathies, ligament sprains, muscle spasms, and the list is endless.
                    <br><br>
                    A qualified physiotherapist will help assess you for any muscle imbalances to include tightness
                    and
                    weakness of the soft tissues. Effective methods of treating such problems will be outlined in
                    forms
                    of things you can do to help yourself and techniques we can perform within our treatment to

                    Stretching is a technique used to increase the length of muscles and tendons in order to improve
                    the
                    effectiveness of the muscle fibres, improve joint range of motion and relieve pain. Your
                    Physiotherapist will advise appropriate stretches to correct muscle length and elasticity.
                    Muscle
                    energy techniques or Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretches are used to lengthen
                    muscles through a hold and relax muscle contraction technique, this generally requires the
                    assistance of your therapist and is widely used by athletes to improve range of movement in a
                    joint
                    both before and after sport to improve performance and reduce risk of injury.

                        which sometimes causes this technique to make a ‘crack’ known as a cavitation. Most commonly
                        spinal joints are those that we may choose to treat with manipulation, although these

    <div class="mt-5">SWIFT is a cutting-edge, FDA cleared technology that has proven to be highly effective in the
        removal of
        plantar warts. It delivers low dose microwave energy through a specialized probe that targets and treats the
        underlying HPV virus by stimulating a natural immune response in the body. SWIFT technology addresses the root
        cause and not the symptoms of plantar warts, thus preventing its recurrence.
